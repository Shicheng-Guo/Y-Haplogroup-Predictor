Y-Haplogroup-Predictor
======================

There are many haplogroup predictors but why this one? This Y-Haplogroup Predictor is unique in the sense it uses artificial intelligence for prediction. The neural network it uses is based on Back Propagation Network with Momentum having a normalized input of 48 bits, a hidden layer of 72 neurons and a normalized output of 5 bits. It had been trained to a level of net error 0.01203 using Neuroph.
